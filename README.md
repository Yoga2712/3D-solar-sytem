# ðŸŒŒ 3D Solar System using Three.js

This project is a 3D visualization of the Solar System built with **Three.js**, a popular JavaScript 3D library. It features orbiting planets, rotating spheres, and realistic textures to create an interactive space simulation.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Realistic representation of planets with textures
- Planetary orbits and self-rotation
- Scaled distances and sizes (not to scale in real units, for visualization)
- Camera controls (zoom, rotate, pan)
- Animated orbits with e`

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (for development server and bundling)
